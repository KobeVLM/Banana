## Port Scan Results (19000-19200)

| Port | Status | Likely Service |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 19014 | Open (TCP) | Main Proxy/Server |
| 19000 | Open (TCP) | Unknown Server |
| 19003 | Open (TCP) | Backend? |

## Exploitation Attempts

| Attack | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Proxy Connection (19014) | ❌ Failed (500 Error / Rejected) |
| Backend Bypass (19015) | ❌ Failed (500 Error / Rejected) |
| Status Ping (All ports) | ❌ Timeout / Offline (Ping Blocked) |

## Conclusion

**Server is SECURE:**
- **Firewalled:** While TCP ports are open, they do not respond to status pings or unauthorized bot handshakes.
- **Online Mode:** Likely enforces premium auth or has strict anti-bot measures.
- **Backend Protection:** Backends (if present on 190xx) are matching the proxy's security or IP-whitelisted.

---

## Recommendations
- The presence of many open ports suggests a **Shared Hosting Environment**. 
- While currently secure against our bot, scanning these ports periodically might reveal a new specific backend that gets misconfigured in the future.
